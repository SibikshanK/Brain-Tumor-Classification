# Brain-Tumor-Classification
Description:
    This project is aimed at classifying magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans into different medical conditions like meningioma, glicoma, pituitary type of brain tumors. I have used the dataset acquired from kaggle and augumented it to increase the number of data for each class.
Requirments:
    ->Python 3.x
    ->TensorFlow 2.x
    ->Numpy
    ->OpenCV
    
Methodolgy:
     I have used Tensorflow, Keras to build CNN model to classify the given image as the respective type of tumor. Using that model I have created a website to check whether a person is signing or not. For this I have used flask framework.
