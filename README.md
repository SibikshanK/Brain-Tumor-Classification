# Brain-Tumor-Classification
* Description:
    This project is aimed at classifying magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans into different medical conditions like meningioma, glicoma, pituitary type of brain tumors. I have used the dataset acquired from kaggle and augumented it to increase the number of data for each class.
* Requirments:
    * Python 3.x
    * TensorFlow 2.x
    * Numpy
    * OpenCV
    
* Methodolgy:
     I have used Tensorflow, Keras to build CNN model to classify the given image as the respective type of tumor. Using that model I have created a website to check whether a person is signing or not. For this I have used flask framework.
